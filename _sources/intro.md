# Note to the reader

In these notes, I will briefly go through the basic notions of Functional Analysis. To put it briefly, I will compile the concepts I consider to be fundamental to the working mathematian. These include: Banach spaces, linear bounded operators, Hilbert spaces and a bit of Duality. So, only the very basic and some useful results. I'll aim for brevity and clarity.

Who's this for? Well, to anyone who's interested in knowing a bit of Functional Analysis, but, at the moment, is in a hurry. Maybe one is studying Harmonic Analysis or Stochastic Calculus and needs to understand what a density argument is... Or maybe one is taking a first course on PDE's... Or maybe(!) one yearns for more mathematical rigour in some Numerical Analysis course. In any case, have a go at these notes. 

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge about vector spaces and Cauchy sequences.
